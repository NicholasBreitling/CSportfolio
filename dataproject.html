<h3>
How does your number of siblings affect your performance in school?
</h3>
  
<p>
in our Data Project, we researched the relationship between a student's number of siblings and their average grade in school. We wanted to
see if it would be best for parents to seperate their children while they are doing homework, to keep them together, or to stay indifferent. 
We took a survey to see if there was a relationship, and got some mixed results:

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
     
<p>
With this data, we determined that a student's number of siblings has no direct effect on their preformance in school. While some 
students say that their siblings are incredibly bothersome while they are doing homework, some students say that their siblings do not 
bother them at all. There are many smaller factors that are in play, such as the age of the siblings and, in simple words, the amount of 
aggrivation that they cause.
