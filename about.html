<h3>My Life as a CS Student</h3>
      
<p>
Currently, I am a taking a computer science course over the summer. I have also been taking courses through the programs YouthDigital and Treehouse, and have been coding for fun using Scratch, Swift Playgrounds, and Constructs 2. I really enjoy problem solving with coding, which is why I enrolled in this Computer Science class. I am very excited to learn how to program in languages like HTML, CSS, and Java, and I hope to one day be able to fully understand and memorize the functions that can be performed with code.
